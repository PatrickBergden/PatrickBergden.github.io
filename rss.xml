      <title>Positionsdimensionering &amp; &lt;br&gt; Anti Martingale Strategier</title>
      <link>http://github.com/patrickbergden//positionsdimensionering</link>
      <description>När jag började med trading gav någon mig rådet att istället direkt spola ner
mitt tradingkapital på toaletten - då skulle jag åtminstonne ha tiden
kvar till annat.

Och visst, trading är svårt - det märker man snabbt.
Ibland kan det kännas som att hela marknaden konspirerar för att ta just dina pengar. Det är helt klart en sink-or-swim-miljö, med många traders på havets botten.

En sak jag tidigt kände mig väldigt osäker kring, var hur stora positioner
jag skulle ta. I början sköt jag från höften och valde positionsstorlek på magkänsla. Newsflash: magkänsla och framgångsrik trading är ingen hit!

Med tiden började jag inse att skärpa inom området risk management var avgörande för om jag skulle ha en chans att hamna på rätt sida om den statistik som säger att 80-90% av alla traders misslyckas.

Så för någon vecka sedan bestämde jag mig för att lära mig hur man kan tänka kring positionsstorlekar i trading.
Resultatet är denna post.

Om du som läser detta blir hjälpt av innehållet, så blir jag naturligtvis glad. Tveka inte att skicka en rad om du har frågor eller upptäcker något som är fel eller kan förbättras. Jag är grymt tacksam för all feedback.

Obs 1, för att hålla beräkningarna enkla har jag valt att bortse från spreads, slippage och courtage-kostnader.

Obs 2, innehållet i denna post skall inte tas som rekomendationer.
Var och en får bilda sig sin egen uppfattning om hur de bäst vill förvalta och riskera sitt kapital.

-----

## Positionsdimensionering
Okay så ett vanligare namn för detta område är Position Sizing, men jag väljer
här att använda mig av positionsdimensionering som term för:

1. Att bestämma storleken på det kapital man väljer att riskera när man öppnar en position.
2. Att tänka kring faktorer som står i relation till positionsstorleken och hur vi kan ta hänsyn till dessa för att försöka gynsamt påverka utsikterna för en planerad trade.

Med andra ord, när du läser positionsdimension så tänk - hur mycket kronor
av den totala tradingdepån man väljer att riskera i en viss trade.

-----

## Martingale Strategi
Enkelt uttryckt så går denna strategi ut på att man dubblar sin risk varje gång
man förlorar.

Låt säga att vi spelar Roulette.
Om vi satar 1kr på rött och förlorar, så säger Martingale strategin att vi i nästa snurr skall dubbla vår risk och alltså satsa 2 kr.
Förlorar vi även denna gång så skall vi vid nästa snurr satsa dubbelt igen, alltså 4 kr.

Tanken är att när vi väl vinner så vinner vi tillbaks de tidigare förlusterna.
Problemet är främst att om vi har otur så hinner vi bränna vårt konto innan
kulan hamnar på vår satsade färg.

Precis som i roulette, så är det i trading omöjligt att säga hur många förlorande sviter vi kommer att innan vi får rätt (kursen går i vår önskade riktning).

Det är åtminstonne en anledning till att Martingale strategin kanske inte är supergrym för någon som vill förbättra sin risk management i trading.
Men det finns ett besläktat alternativ.

## Anti Martingale Strategi
Denna strategi föreslår att vi istället ökar vår risk så länge vi vinner och
kursen går i vår önskade riktning.

Observera att vi inte uttryckligen säger att man måste dubble in risk.
Det räcker med att öka risken för att följa strategin.

I Roulette-exempelet ovan så blir alltså skillnaden att vi __ökar__ vår risk
varje gång vi vinner. Exempel, satsar vi 1 krona och vinner så kan vi välja att
satsa 1.5kr vid nästa snurr.

På detta vis minskar risken avseevärt för att en förlorande svit skall äta upp
allt vårt kapital innan vi vinner igen.


## R som i Risk

När jag tar en position innebär det att jag tittar på min tradingdepå och
avgör hur stor del av denna (i procent eller kronor) som jag vill riskera när jag
öppnar positionen.

Om jag handlar 50st aktier som kostar 100 kr styck, så blir min R (risk) 5000kr (100kr*50=5000kr).

## R-multipler
Istället för att tala om profiter och förluster i kronor, så kan vi nu tala om R-multipler.

Om aktien ovan går upp och blir värd 400kr styck så kan jag istället för att tala om en profit på 50*(400-100)=15.000 kr, istället
betrakta det som att jag har en 3R profit (15.000/5.000=3).

Fördelen är att vi nu kan prata i största allmänhet om profit och förlust i form av R-Multipler.


&lt;pre&gt;Exempel
Om R motsvarar 5 investerade kronor och marknaden går upp 30 kr då har du gjort en förtjänst på 6R (30/5=6).
Om R motsvarar 6 investerade kronor och marknaden går ner 60 kr då har du
en gjort en förlust på 10R (60/6=10).
&lt;/pre&gt;


Vi kan uttrycka förluster och förtjänster i form av R.
Köper vi 100 st aktier som kostar 10 kr styck så är risken 1000 kr.
Om vi senare säljer dessa aktier och gör en förtjänst på 40 000 kr så
kan vi säga att vi gjort en 40000/1000=40, 40R förtjänst.

Exempel: vi köper 100st FING aktier för 400 kr = 40 000 kr och sätter en stopp loss
på 2% - det vill säga att vi (om vi är long) placerar en stop limit order på 392 kr.
I detta fall är alltså R = 400 * 100 - 392 * 100 = 800 kr.

Du riskar 700 kr (R) och gör senare en profit på 2800 kr, detta motsvarar då en 4R profit (2800/700=4).

Du riskar 5000 kr (R) och gör senare en förlust på 2500 kr, detta motsvarar då en 0.5R (2500/5000=0.5) förlust.

Du riskar 50 kr per aktie och gör en
förlust på 100 kr per aktie, detta motsvarar då en 2R förlust (100/50=2).

Målsättningen är att ha stora R-Multiple profiter och max 1R förluster.



#### Beräkna R-Multipler vid aktieköp

1. Först räknar jag ut hur mycket risk jag lägger.  
Detta blir min 1R.
2. Sedan multiplicerar jag 1R med antal aktier.
3. Nu räknar jag ut total profit (eller förlust) inklusive courtage.
4. Nu delar jag det värdet jag räknade ut i föregående steg med den initiala risken.
5. Till sist får jag R-Multipeln som en vinst eller förlust.

#### Hur många aktier skall jag köpa?
Säg att jag handlar FING vid $23 per aktie, med en stopp loss på 25%.  

Det betyder att stop lossen är placerad vid:  
$23*0.25 = $5.75
$23-5.75 = $17,25 per aktie.  

Om jag nu väljer att riska 1% av mitt totala kapital, vi säger att det är 100 000 kr, så innebär det att jag skall handla $1000/5.75=174 FING-aktier till ett pris på $23, och en total summa i cash på $4 000 kr.  

Om aktien går ner 25% från $23 till
$17,25 så säljer vi.

#### Vad blir R-Multipeln vid en profit?  
Om jag köpte 174 aktier för $23 och senare säljer dessa för $38 gör jag en
profit på $38*174 - $23*174 =  $2610.  
Nu delar jag denna summa med min risk för att få min R-Multipel:
$2610/$1000=2.61R profit.




## Expectancy
Expectancy är ett mått på förväntat resultat i ett trading system.
Formeln är: Summa R-Multiples / Number of trades.

[1R, -2R, 4R, 1.1R, 3R] / 5 = 1.42 R

Det skulle betyda att varje investering som använder vårt tradingsystem bör
ge oss i genomsnitt 1.42 ggr profit på satsat kapital.

&lt;!-- ### Strategier för att avgöra storleken på Global Positioner --&gt;





##Kapitalmodeller
Så, nu är frågan - hur mycket kaptial skall jag satsa när jag bestämt mig för att
ta en position? Här är tre modeller.

### 1. Totalt Kapital

En enkel men antaligen för aggresiv modell är att helt enkelt satsa en fix procent av totalt kapital vid varje trade.

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;mark&gt;Exempel Total Kapital&lt;/mark&gt;
Säg att jag har ett totalt kapital på 100 000 kr.
Låt oss även säga att jag bestämt mig för att alltid
riska 1% i mina trades.

Om jag nu vill ta en position i FING så betyder det
att jag skall köpa FING för 100 000*0.01 = 1 000 kr.

Senare på eftermiddagen ser jag att ERICA rör sig i den
riktning jag hoppats på och öppnar däför ytterligare en
postion.

Återigen riskar jag 1% av mitt totala kapital och öppnar
en position till ett värde av 1 000 kr.

Nu har jag två aktiva positioner med en sammanlagd risk
på 2000 kr och 100 000 - 2000 = 98 000 kr i cash.
&lt;/pre&gt;


Med andra ord - jag tar inte hänsyn till hur det går för mina öppna positioner när jag positionsdimensionerar.


Med tanke på att många trades blir förluster är detta
som sagt en ganska aggresiv modell.


### 2. Core Kapital

I denna modell bestämmer vi storleken på positionerna utifrån faktiskt
tillgänglig cash i vårt totala kapital.
Vi tar inte hänsyn till öppna positioner förräns de stängts.

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;mark&gt;Exempel Core Kapital&lt;/mark&gt;

Totalt kapital: 100 000 kr  
Vi öppnar en position på 1% av det totala kapitalet:
100 000 * 0.01 = 1 000 kr  

När vi tagit vår position är tillgänglig cash:  
100 000 - 1 000 kr = 99 000 kr  

Nu öppnar vi ytterligare en position.
Även denna gång riskar vi 1% av totalt kapital.
Men denna gång blir det:
99 000 * 0.01 = 990 kr

När vi tagit vår andra position är tillgänglig cash:  
99 000 - 990 kr = 98 010 kr.
&lt;/pre&gt;

Att tänka på - vi betraktar våra öppna positioner som förlorat kapital fram tills dess att vi stängt positionen (till vinst eller förlust).

Det kan vara ett bra sätt att tänka kring placeringar och tillgängligt kapital.
Så vi antar helt enkelt att det kapital som investerats i olika positioenr
är förlorat fram till dess att vi stängt positionen.


### 3. Reducerat Totalt Kapital
Även denna model bygger på tillgänglig cash, men tar hänsyn till de pengar vi låser in när vi flyttar våra stopp lossar.

I likhet med Core modellen räknar vi kapital i öppna
possitioner som förlorade - med till skillnad från Core så blir dessa pengar återigen en del av vårt totala kapital om/när vi flyttar våra stopp lossar så att risken blir starkt minimerad.

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;mark&gt;Exempel Reducerat Totalt Kapital&lt;/mark&gt;  
Säg att jag börjar med ett totalt kapital på 100 000 kr.
Jag tar en position på 1% av detta totala kapital,
dvs 1 000 kr.  

Säg nu att aktiekursen börjar gå min väg.
Jag sätter i så fall en stopp loss som gör att jag
går ur om jag förlorar 500 kr
(tex 100 st aktier för 1 kr med en stopp loss
på 0.50 kr).  

Positionens storlek: 1000 kr
Stopp lossen är satt vid 500 kr, det vill säga att jag
säljer om positionens värde går ner till 500 kr.  

10 st aktier till priset av 100 kr = 1000 kr
Priset går ner till 50 kr -&gt; 10*50 kr = 500 kr
&lt;/pre&gt;

I Core hade vi räknat total kapital till 99 000 kr
I Core blir det istället 99500 kr




-----
## Skala in positioner med Anti Martingale Strategin
Strategin är enkel:

+   När en aktie går upp 25% från det pris vi köpte den för
så öppnar vi ytterligare en position i samma aktie.
+   Vi riskar då ytterligare risk, vars storlek då styrs av vilken kapitalmodell vi föredrar (se ovan).
+   Vi gör detta upp till fyra gånger.

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;mark&gt;Exempel Skala in Position&lt;/mark&gt;  
Säg att jag har ett Total Kapital på 100 000 kr.  

Jag bestämer mig för att riska 1% av detta totala
kapital, alltså 1 000 kr.

Jag väljer att följa Core Kapitalmodellen när jag
beräknar hur mycket jag skall riska i nästföljande positioner.  

Min trailing stopp loss sätter jag på 25% - alltså
en bred stopp.

Jag börjar med att köpa FING när den kostar 460 kr
per aktie.

Det betyder att jag skall köpa:
1000/(460*0.25) = 8 aktier
till ett pris på 8*460 = 3680 kr

Säg nu att aktiens pris ökar med 25% upp till
460 * 1.25 = 587,50 kr.
Jag öppnar (skalar in) ytterligare en 1% position.  

Då jag valt att använda Core Kapitalmodellen så
skall jag köpa:  
100 000 - 1000 = 99 000 kr
99 000 * 0.01 = 990 kr  
990 / (587,50 * 0.25) = 6.74 ≈ 6 aktier,
för en totalsumma på 6 * 587,50 ≈ 3525 kr
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

## Stop the Loss

### Tight Stop Loss
Det finns fördelar  och nackdelar med en tight stop.

#### Tight Stop uttryckt i Procent
Jag tar 5% som exempel på en tight stop i uttryckt i procent.

Om jag vill riska 5000 kr - säg att jag har ett total kapital på 500 000 kr - för at köpa AZN @ 550kr så skall jag köpa:
&lt;pre&gt;5000 / (550*0.05) = 181,82 ≈ 181 aktier&lt;/pre&gt;

Det betyder också att om priset på AZN går ner 5% till 522,50 kr så kommer jag att stoppas ur och har då gjort en förlust på 5 000 kr.

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tradingview.com/x/zxvm2VHr/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/azn_tightstop_01.png&quot; &gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

#### Tight Stop uttryckt i Points
&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/04/043004.asp#ixzz3yu4hVqso&quot;&gt;För aktier gäller allmänt att&lt;/a&gt;: For stocks, one point equals one dollar. So when you hear that a stock has lost or gained X number of &quot;points&quot;, this is the same as saying that the stock has lost or gained X number of dollars.

En tight stopp loss uttryckt i points skulle kunna vara 2 points - alltså $2.

&lt;pre&gt;Om jag vill riska $1000 med en $2 stopp så skall jag
alltså köpa $1000/2 = 500 aktier.
&lt;/pre&gt;

#### Nackdelar med en tight stopp loss

En tight stopp innebär att jag kommer att stoppas ur rätt ofta. Av den anledningen är det viktigt att vara försiktig när intradag voltilitet är hög.

En annan nackdel är att jag kommer att behöva köpa mer
aktier när jag har en tight stop och på så vis binda upp mer av mitt kapital.

&lt;pre&gt;
En stopp loss på 5% innebär att jag behöver köpa  
1R/0.05 = 20R i aktier.

Med en 25% stopp loss behöver jag bara köpa  
1R/0.25 =  4R i aktier.

I fallet med Astra Zeneca aktierna skulle det innebära att
jag handlar
5000 / (550*0.25) = 36,36 ≈ 36 aktier
till en kostnad på 36*550 = 19 800 kr.

Jämför detta med 181 aktier
till en kostnad på 181*550 = 99 550 kr, eller 20%
av vårt totala kapital på 100 000 kr.
&lt;/pre&gt;

#### Fördelar med en tight stopp loss

Det är enkelare att få en hög R-Multipel när vi använder en tight stopp. Får vi en förlust så är även denna relativt liten vid en tight stopp loss.


&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/slippage.asp#ixzz3yuIfAWgh&quot;&gt;Slippage&lt;/a&gt;: The difference between the expected price of a trade, and the price the trade actually executes at. Slippage often occurs during periods of higher volatility, when market orders are used, and also when large orders are executed when there may not be enough interest at the desired price level to maintain the expected price of trade.

### Bred Stop Loss
En bred stopp skulle kunna vara en 25% trailing stopp
eller till exempel en 100 kr stop på AZN.

#### Fördelar och nackdelar med en bred stopp
+   Jag riskerar inte att stoppas ut lika ofta.
+   Jag behöver heller inte binda upp så mycket kapital
eftersom att jag kan köpa en mindre mängd aktier.
+   Jag kan uppleva det som att kursen oftare rör sig i enlighet med min TA eftersom att jag inte stoppas ut på grund av intradagsvolatiliteten i aktien.

Nackdelen är att jag får en mindre R-Multipel - kursen
måste rör sig oerhört mycket för att jag skall kunna få en hög R-Multipel.

-----

### Volatilitetsbaserad Positionsdimensionering
Hur kan vi ta vara på fördelar från både en tight stop och en bred stop?
En möjlighet är att välja storleken på stop lossen utifrån aktiens volatilitet.

Om vi helt enkelt tar reda på de senaste dagarnas volatilitet i aktien, så kan
vi använda denna för vår positionsdimensionering.

Det kan dessutom vara smart att multiplicera denna volatilitet med en faktor så att vi håller oss utanför rangen och sänker risken för att stoppas ut.

Om TLSN de senaste 5 dagarna i genomsnitt haft en range på 10 kr, så kan jag
till exempel välja att sätta min stop loss 2 ggr detta värde under det pris jag väljer att ta en position.

&lt;pre&gt;
Exempel

Säg att den genomsnitliga rangen de senaste tre dagarna
i FING är 20 kr.  

Istället för att som tidigare köpa 1000/2 = 75 aktier
så köper vi nu istället:
1 000 / 50 = 20 aktier  

Jag sätter stopp lossen på 20 kr * 2 = 40 kr
För ett aktuellt pris på 550 kr så blir det 550 - 40 = 510 kr.
&lt;/pre&gt;

##### Här är ett liknande exempel med Telia Sonera (priset i Euro)

I första grafen ser vi att priset ser ut att börja gå sidleds mellan 0.5 och
full retrace på fibben. Jag söker därför att korta aktien nästa gång den är på
väg upp för att testa resistance nivån (.5 fib nivån).

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tradingview.com/x/CRFbZojd/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/tlsn_01.png&quot; &gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Aktien studsar som väntat mot resistance nivån (fib 0.5).
Molnet som omger priset representerar de fem senaste dagarnas genomsnittliga range, multiplicerat med den stop loss risk jag vill ha - i detta fall 2 ggr genomsnittlig rangen.

&lt;pre&gt;
Exempel
Om priset på en aktie i varierat med 10 kr per dag &lt;/pre&gt;

      <link>http://github.com/patrickbergden//the-businessman-and-fisherman</link>
      <description>An American businessman took a vacation to a small coastal Mexican village on doctor’s orders. Unable to sleep after an urgent phone call from the office the first morning, he walked out to the pier to clear his head. A small boat with just one fisherman had docked, and inside the boat were several large yellowfin tuna. The American complimented the Mexican on the quality of his fish.

      <title>I Have a Dream</title>
      <link>http://github.com/patrickbergden//i-have-a-dream</link>
      <description>I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.

Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity.

But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. And so we've come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.

In a sense we've come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the &quot;unalienable Rights&quot; of &quot;Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.&quot; It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note, insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked &quot;insufficient funds.&quot;

But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. And so, we've come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice.

We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of Now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children.

It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning. And those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. And there will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.

But there is something that I must say to my people, who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice: In the process of gaining our rightful place, we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred. We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again, we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force.

The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom.

We cannot walk alone.

And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead.

We cannot turn back.

There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, &quot;When will you be satisfied?&quot; We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality. We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities. We cannot be satisfied as long as the negro's basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one. We can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their self-hood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating: &quot;For Whites Only.&quot; We cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote. No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until &quot;justice rolls down like waters, and righteousness like a mighty stream.&quot;

I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells. And some of you have come from areas where your quest -- quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive. Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed.

Let us not wallow in the valley of despair, I say to you today, my friends.

And so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.

I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: &quot;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.&quot;

I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.

I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.

I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.

I have a **dream** today!

I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of &quot;interposition&quot; and &quot;nullification&quot; -- one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.

I have a **dream** today!

I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight; &quot;and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together.&quot;

This is our hope, and this is the faith that I go back to the South with.

With this faith, we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith, we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith, we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.

And this will be the day -- this will be the day when all of God's children will be able to sing with new meaning:

&gt;  My country 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing.
&gt;  
&gt;  Land where my fathers died, land of the Pilgrim's pride,
&gt;  
&gt;  From every mountainside, let freedom ring!


And if America is to be a great nation, this must become true.

And so let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire.

&gt;  Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York.
&gt;  
&gt;  Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania.
&gt;  
&gt;  Let freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of Colorado.
&gt;  
&gt;  Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California.


But not only that:

&gt;  Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia.
&gt;  
&gt;  Let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee.
&gt;  
&gt;  Let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi.
&gt;  
&gt;  From every mountainside, let freedom ring.


And when this happens, and when we allow freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual:

*Free at last! Free at last!*

*Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!*

      <title>The Purpose of Education</title>
      <link>http://github.com/patrickbergden//the-purpose-of-education</link>
      <description>As I engage in the so-called &quot;bull sessions&quot; around and about the school, I too often find that most college men have a misconception of the purpose of education. Most of the &quot;brethren&quot; think that education should equip them with the proper instruments of exploitation so that they can forever trample over the masses. Still others think that education should furnish them with noble ends rather than means to an end.

      <description>I had this story from one who had no business to tell it to me, or to any other. I may credit the seductive influence of an old vintage upon the narrator for the beginning of it, and my own skeptical incredulity during the days that followed for the balance of the strange tale.

      <title>Looking-Glass house</title>
      <link>http://github.com/patrickbergden//looking-glass-house</link>
      <description>One thing was certain, that the white kitten had had nothing to do with it:— it was the black kitten’s fault entirely. For the white kitten had been having its face washed by the old cat for the last quarter of an hour (and bearing it pretty well, considering); so you see that it couldn’t have had any hand in the mischief. 
The way Dinah washed her children’s faces was this: first she held the poor thing down by its ear with one paw, and then with the other paw she rubbed its face all over, the wrong way, beginning at the nose: and just now, as I said, she was hard at work on the white kitten, which was lying quite still and trying to purr — no doubt feeling that it was all meant for its good. 
But the black kitten had been finished with earlier in the afternoon, and so, while Alice was sitting curled up in a corner of the great arm-chair, half talking to herself and half asleep, the kitten had been having a grand game of romps with the ball of worsted Alice had been trying to wind up, and had been rolling it up and down till it had all come undone again; and there it was, spread over the hearth-rug, all knots and tangles, with the kitten running after its own tail in the middle.

‘Oh, you wicked little thing!’ cried Alice, catching up the kitten, and giving it a little kiss to make it understand that it was in disgrace. ‘Really, Dinah ought to have taught you better manners! You ought, Dinah, you know you ought!’ she added, looking reproachfully at the old cat, and speaking in as cross a voice as she could manage — and then she scrambled back into the arm-chair, taking the kitten and the worsted with her, and began winding up the ball again. But she didn’t get on very fast, as she was talking all the time, sometimes to the kitten, and sometimes to herself. Kitty sat very demurely on her knee, pretending to watch the progress of the winding, and now and then putting out one paw and gently touching the ball, as if it would be glad to help, if it might. ‘Do you know what to-morrow is, Kitty?’ Alice began. ‘You’d have guessed if you’d been up in the window with me — only Dinah was making you tidy, so you couldn’t. I was watching the boys getting in sticks for the bonfire — and it wants plenty of sticks, Kitty! Only it got so cold, and it snowed so, they had to leave off. Never mind, Kitty, we’ll go and see the bonfire to-morrow.’ Here Alice wound two or three turns of the worsted round the kitten’s neck, just to see how it would look: this led to a scramble, in which the ball rolled down upon the floor, and yards and yards of it got unwound again.

‘Do you know, I was so angry, Kitty,’ Alice went on as soon as they were comfortably settled again, ‘when I saw all the mischief you had been doing, I was very nearly opening the window, and putting you out into the snow! And you’d have deserved it, you little mischievous darling! What have you got to say for yourself? Now don’t interrupt me!’ she went on, holding up one finger. ‘I’m going to tell you all your faults. Number one: you squeaked twice while Dinah was washing your face this morning. Now you can’t deny it, Kitty: I heard you! What’s that you say?’ (pretending that the kitten was speaking.) ‘Her paw went into your eye? Well, that’s your fault, for keeping your eyes open — if you’d shut them tight up, it wouldn’t have happened. Now don’t make any more excuses, but listen! Number two: you pulled Snowdrop away by the tail just as I had put down the saucer of milk before her! What, you were thirsty, were you? How do you know she wasn’t thirsty too? Now for number three: you unwound every bit of the worsted while I wasn’t looking! 
‘That’s three faults, Kitty, and you’ve not been punished for any of them yet. You know I’m saving up all your punishments for Wednesday week — Suppose they had saved up all my punishments!’ she went on, talking more to herself than the kitten. ‘What would they do at the end of a year? I should be sent to prison, I suppose, when the day came. Or — let me see — suppose each punishment was to be going without a dinner: then, when the miserable day came, I should have to go without fifty dinners at once! Well, I shouldn’t mind that much! I’d far rather go without them than eat them! ‘Do you hear the snow against the window-panes, Kitty? How nice and soft it sounds! Just as if some one was kissing the window all over outside. I wonder if the snow loves the trees and fields, that it kisses them so gently? And then it covers them up snug, you know, with a white quilt; and perhaps it says, “Go to sleep, darlings, till the summer comes again.” And when they wake up in the summer, Kitty, they dress themselves all in green, and dance about — whenever the wind blows — oh, that’s very pretty!’ cried Alice, dropping the ball of worsted to clap her hands. ‘And I do so wish it was true! I’m sure the woods look sleepy in the autumn, when the leaves are getting brown. ‘Kitty, can you play chess? Now, don’t smile, my dear, I’m asking it seriously. Because, when we were playing just now, you watched just as if you understood it: and when I said “Check!” you purred! Well, it was a nice check, Kitty, and really I might have won, if it hadn’t been for that nasty Knight, that came wiggling down among my pieces. Kitty, dear, let’s pretend —’ And here I wish I could tell you half the things Alice used to say, beginning with her favourite phrase ‘Let’s pretend.’ She had had quite a long argument with her sister only the day before — all because Alice had begun with ‘Let’s pretend we’re kings and queens;’ and her sister, who liked being very exact, had argued that they couldn’t, because there were only two of them, and Alice had been reduced at last to say, ‘Well, you can be one of them then, and I’ll be all the rest.’ And once she had really frightened her old nurse by shouting suddenly in her ear, ‘Nurse! Do let’s pretend that I’m a hungry hyaena, and you’re a bone.’ But this is taking us away from Alice’s speech to the kitten. ‘Let’s pretend that you’re the Red Queen, Kitty! Do you know, I think if you sat up and folded your arms, you’d look exactly like her. Now do try, there’s a dear!’ And Alice got the Red Queen off the table, and set it up before the kitten as a model for it to imitate: however, the thing didn’t succeed, principally, Alice said, because the kitten wouldn’t fold its arms properly. So, to punish it, she held it up to the Looking-glass, that it might see how sulky it was —‘and if you’re not good directly,’ she added, ‘I’ll put you through into Looking-glass House. How would you like that?’ 
‘Now, if you’ll only attend, Kitty, and not talk so much, I’ll tell you all my ideas about Looking-glass House. First, there’s the room you can see through the glass — that’s just the same as our drawing room, only the things go the other way. I can see all of it when I get upon a chair — all but the bit behind the fireplace. Oh! I do so wish I could see that bit! I want so much to know whether they’ve a fire in the winter: you never can tell, you know, unless our fire smokes, and then smoke comes up in that room too — but that may be only pretence, just to make it look as if they had a fire. Well then, the books are something like our books, only the words go the wrong way; I know that, because I’ve held up one of our books to the glass, and then they hold up one in the other room. ‘How would you like to live in Looking-glass House, Kitty? I wonder if they’d give you milk in there? Perhaps Looking-glass milk isn’t good to drink — But oh, Kitty! now we come to the passage. You can just see a little peep of the passage in Looking-glass House, if you leave the door of our drawing-room wide open: and it’s very like our passage as far as you can see, only you know it may be quite different on beyond. Oh, Kitty! how nice it would be if we could only get through into Looking-glass House! I’m sure it’s got, oh! such beautiful things in it! Let’s pretend there’s a way of getting through into it, somehow, Kitty. Let’s pretend the glass has got all soft like gauze, so that we can get through. Why, it’s turning into a sort of mist now, I declare! It’ll be easy enough to get through —’ She was up on the chimney-piece while she said this, though she hardly knew how she had got there. And certainly the glass was beginning to melt away, just like a bright silvery mist.

In another moment Alice was through the glass, and had jumped lightly down into the Looking-glass room. The very first thing she did was to look whether there was a fire in the fireplace, and she was quite pleased to find that there was a real one, blazing away as brightly as the one she had left behind. ‘So I shall be as warm here as I was in the old room,’ thought Alice: ‘warmer, in fact, because there’ll be no one here to scold me away from the fire. Oh, what fun it’ll be, when they see me through the glass in here, and can’t get at me!’

Then she began looking about, and noticed that what could be seen from the old room was quite common and uninteresting, but that all the rest was as different as possible. For instance, the pictures on the wall next the fire seemed to be all alive, and the very clock on the chimney-piece (you know you can only see the back of it in the Looking-glass) had got the face of a little old man, and grinned at her. 
‘They don’t keep this room so tidy as the other,’ Alice thought to herself, as she noticed several of the chessmen down in the hearth among the cinders: but in another moment, with a little ‘Oh!’ of surprise, she was down on her hands and knees watching them. The chessmen were walking about, two and two!

‘Here are the Red King and the Red Queen,’ Alice said (in a whisper, for fear of frightening them), ‘and there are the White King and the White Queen sitting on the edge of the shovel — and here are two castles walking arm in arm — I don’t think they can hear me,’ she went on, as she put her head closer down, ‘and I’m nearly sure they can’t see me. I feel somehow as if I were invisible —’ Here something began squeaking on the table behind Alice, and made her turn her head just in time to see one of the White Pawns roll over and begin kicking: she watched it with great curiosity to see what would happen next. 
‘It is the voice of my child!’ the White Queen cried out as she rushed past the King, so violently that she knocked him over among the cinders. ‘My precious Lily! My imperial kitten!’ and she began scrambling wildly up the side of the fender. ‘Imperial fiddlestick!’ said the King, rubbing his nose, which had been hurt by the fall. He had a right to be a little annoyed with the Queen, for he was covered with ashes from head to foot. Alice was very anxious to be of use, and, as the poor little Lily was nearly screaming herself into a fit, she hastily picked up the Queen and set her on the table by the side of her noisy little daughter. 
The Queen gasped, and sat down: the rapid journey through the air had quite taken away her breath and for a minute or two she could do nothing but hug the little Lily in silence. As soon as she had recovered her breath a little, she called out to the White King, who was sitting sulkily among the ashes, ‘Mind the volcano!’ 
‘What volcano?’ said the King, looking up anxiously into the fire, as if he thought that was the most likely place to find one. ‘Blew — me — up,’ panted the Queen, who was still a little out of breath. ‘Mind you come up — the regular way — don’t get blown up!’ Alice watched the White King as he slowly struggled up from bar to bar, till at last she said, ‘Why, you’ll be hours and hours getting to the table, at that rate. I’d far better help you, hadn’t I?’ But the King took no notice of the question: it was quite clear that he could neither hear her nor see her. 
So Alice picked him up very gently, and lifted him across more slowly than she had lifted the Queen, that she mightn’t take his breath away: but, before she put him on the table, she thought she might as well dust him a little, he was so covered with ashes.

She said afterwards that she had never seen in all her life such a face as the King made, when he found himself held in the air by an invisible hand, and being dusted: he was far too much astonished to cry out, but his eyes and his mouth went on getting larger and larger, and rounder and rounder, till her hand shook so with laughing that she nearly let him drop upon the floor. 
‘Oh! please don’t make such faces, my dear!’ she cried out, quite forgetting that the King couldn’t hear her. ‘You make me laugh so that I can hardly hold you! And don’t keep your mouth so wide open! All the ashes will get into it — there, now I think you’re tidy enough!’ she added, as she smoothed his hair, and set him upon the table near the Queen. The King immediately fell flat on his back, and lay perfectly still: and Alice was a little alarmed at what she had done, and went round the room to see if she could find any water to throw over him. However, she could find nothing but a bottle of ink, and when she got back with it she found he had recovered, and he and the Queen were talking together in a frightened whisper — so low, that Alice could hardly hear what they said. 
The King was saying, ‘I assure, you my dear, I turned cold to the very ends of my whiskers!’ 
To which the Queen replied, ‘You haven’t got any whiskers.’ 
‘The horror of that moment,’ the King went on, ‘I shall never, never forget!’ ‘You will, though,’ the Queen said, ‘if you don’t make a memorandum of it.’ Alice looked on with great interest as the King took an enormous memorandum-book out of his pocket, and began writing. A sudden thought struck her, and she took hold of the end of the pencil, which came some way over his shoulder, and began writing for him. 
The poor King looked puzzled and unhappy, and struggled with the pencil for some time without saying anything; but Alice was too strong for him, and at last he panted out, ‘My dear! I really must get a thinner pencil. I can’t manage this one a bit; it writes all manner of things that I don’t intend —’ 
‘What manner of things?’ said the Queen, looking over the book (in which Alice had put ‘the White Knight is sliding down the poker. He balances very badly’) ‘That’s not a memorandum of your feelings!’

      <title>Down The Rabbit Hole</title>
      <link>http://github.com/patrickbergden//down-the-rabbit-hole</link>
      <description>Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or conversation?'

So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.

There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, 'Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.

In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.

The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.

Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled 'ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.

'Well!' thought Alice to herself, 'after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!' (Which was very likely true.)

Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end! 'I wonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud. 'I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think—' (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) '—yes, that's about the right distance—but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I've got to?' (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)

Presently she began again. 'I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—' (she was rather glad there was no one listening, this time, as it didn't sound at all the right word) '—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy curtseying as you're falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) 'And what an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'

Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. 'Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!' (Dinah was the cat.) 'I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?' And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, 'Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, 'Do bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either question, it didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, 'Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.

Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, 'Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting!' She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.

There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.

Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them.

However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!

Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head though the doorway; 'and even if my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, 'it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only know how to begin.' For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.

There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, ('which certainly was not here before,' said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words 'DRINK ME' beautifully printed on it in large letters.

It was all very well to say 'Drink me,' but the wise little Alice was not going to do that in a hurry. 'No, I'll look first,' she said, 'and see whether it's marked &quot;poison&quot; or not'; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked 'poison,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.

However, this bottle was not marked 'poison,' so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.

'What a curious feeling!' said Alice; 'I must be shutting up like a telescope.'

And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; 'for it might end, you know,' said Alice to herself, 'in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?' And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.

After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.

'Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to herself, rather sharply; 'I advise you to leave off this minute!' She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. 'But it's no use now,' thought poor Alice, 'to pretend to be two people! Why, there's hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person!'

Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words 'EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants. 'Well, I'll eat it,' said Alice, 'and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I'll get into the garden, and I don't care which happens!'

She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, 'Which way? Which way?', holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.

So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.

      <link>http://github.com/patrickbergden//gettysburg-address</link>
      <description>Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.

Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.

But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate-we can not consecrate-we can not hallow-this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us-that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion-that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain-that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom-and that government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the earth.
